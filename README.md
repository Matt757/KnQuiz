WordPress plugin for creating quizzes with multiple types of questions available

On the admin side, the plugin comes with 4 submenus:

The first submenu offers an interface for customizing right and wrong messages, button texts, and global values for quizzes.

The quizzes submenu offers an interface for adding a new quiz, editing, or deleting an existing quiz. You can also change the order of the questions in a quiz and get the shortcode that adds the quiz to the web page.

The questions submenu offers an interface for adding a new question for a specific quiz, editing, or deleting existing questions. Here we also have the shortcodes for the corresponding quiz.

The statistics submenu shows who played which quiz, what score they received, how many attempts they used, and when the highest score was achieved.

To display the quiz on the client side, the corresponding shortcode must be included. Here is an example of such a shortcode: [kqn id=17 title=1 description=1]. The id value is the id of the quiz, the title can be displayed with 1 or hidden with 0, as well as the description. The plugin offers the possibility to add pictures to the text of a question, and the picture can be displayed on top of the question, below, to the right, or to the left.

The plugin offers customization options for colors. There is a main color, used for hovers and draggable objects, a neutral color, a color for right answers, and one for wrong answers. The colors can be set globally for all quizzes or particularly for a certain quiz:
